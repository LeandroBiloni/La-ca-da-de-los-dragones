# Unity-La-ca-da-de-los-dragones-2019
2D Platform game made for Programming Logic Assignment.
My first project made during Videogame Design and Programming career.
You have to beat the dragons and ascend to defeat the Emperor Dragon.
You can collect the energy of the dragons which will increase your damage and make it easier to defeat them.
